# Flat

There is already [Array.prototype.flat()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flat) in JavaScript (ES2019), which reduces the nesting of Array.

Could you manage to implement your own one?

Here is an example to illustrate:

```
const arr = [1, [2], [3, [4]]];

flat(arr)
// [1, 2, 3, [4]]

flat(arr, 1)
// [1, 2, 3, [4]]

flat(arr, 2)
// [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Are you able to solve it both recursively and iteratively?
